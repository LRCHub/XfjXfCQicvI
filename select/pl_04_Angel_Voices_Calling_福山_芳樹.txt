The race of life is nearly o'er
And the night
around me's falling
As one by one
the stars shine through
I hear angel voices calling
Bright beings come to welcome me
To my eternal dwelling
Though once hard-pressed,
all that fills my breast
Is joy beyond the telling
When just a lad
I roamed these hills
From whence I take my parting
And yet no place on earth's
so dear
As the land for which
I'm starting
Bright beings come to welcome me
To my eternal dwelling
Though once hard-pressed,
all that fills my breast
Is joy beyond the telling
The gates of pearl,
I see them now
Everlasting morn has broken
The victor's crown is on my brow
Of olive branches woven
Bright beings come to welcome me
To my eternal dwelling
Though once hard-pressed,
all that fills my breast
Is joy beyond the telling
